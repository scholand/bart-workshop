## Schedule

#### **Digital Objects and Synthetic MRI with BART**
Based on the abstract: 

> Nick Scholand, Martin Schilling, Martin Heide, Martin Uecker. Digital Reference Objects with BART. In Proc. Intl. Soc. Mag. Reson. Med. 31; 3118 (2023)

This contains a standalone tutorial that shows how to use BART's `phantom` tool. The focus is on how to create digital objects with arbitrary geometries (defined by SVG files), 3D coil-sensitivities and on how to combine both with Bloch simulations to create realistic synthetic MRI data. The tutorial is self-documented within the directory. It is set up as jupyter notebook and can be run interactively using Binder or Google Colaboratory.
