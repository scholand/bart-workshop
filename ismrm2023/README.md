#### **Digital Objects Interface**
Based on the abstract: 

> Nick Scholand, Martin Schilling, Martin Heide, Martin Uecker. Digital Reference Objects with BART. In Proc. Intl. Soc. Mag. Reson. Med. 31; 3118 (2023)

This contains a standalone demo that shows how to use BART's phantom tool. The specific focus is on how to create digital objects with arbitrary geometries and 3D coil-sensitivities as well as on how to combine the complex geometries with Bloch simulations to create synthetic MRI data. The demo is self-documented within the directory. The tutorial is set up as jupyter notebook and can interactively be tested using Binder or Google Colaboratory.
